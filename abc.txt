a list of ten principles which a softwareâ€™s license must adhere to for it to be considered open-source:

Free Redistribution - The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of a larger software distribution containing programs from multiple sources.
Source Code - The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form.
Derived Works - The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.
Integrity of The Author's Source Code - The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time.
No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups - The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.
No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor - The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor.
Distribution of License - The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.
License Must Not Be Specific to a Product - The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution.
License Must Not Restrict Other Software - The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software.
License Must Be Technology-Neutral - No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.
